# CodeConnect-NestJs

## Overview

CodeConnect-NestJs is a collaborative backend platform built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) that empowers developers to connect, share code, and receive AI-powered code suggestions. It features real-time notifications, video/audio rooms via LiveKit, and robust authentication (including GitHub OAuth). The project is designed for developer communities to interact, post code snippets, comment, and get AI-driven help for code issues.

## Main Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and manage user profiles. Supports JWT and GitHub OAuth.
- **Posts & Comments**: Share code snippets, text, images, and videos. Comment and react to posts.
- **AI Code Help**: Get AI-powered suggestions for code problems using OpenAI (guidance only, no full solutions).
- **LiveKit Integration**: Create and join real-time video/audio rooms for collaborative sessions.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Receive instant notifications for new posts, comments, likes, and more via WebSockets.
- **Microservices & RabbitMQ**: Scalable architecture using RabbitMQ for event-driven notifications.
- **Swagger API Docs**: Interactive API documentation available at `/api`.
